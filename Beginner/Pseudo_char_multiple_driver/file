Linux drivers are essential components of the operating system that allow the kernel to communicate with hardware devices. They provide an abstraction layer between the hardware and user-space applications, enabling seamless interaction with devices such as network cards, storage drives, graphics cards, and peripherals. Drivers in Linux are typically written in C and can be either built directly into the kernel or loaded as modules at runtime. They handle tasks like device initialization, data transfer, and interrupt handling, ensuring that hardware operates efficiently and reliably within the Linux environment. The Linux kernel supports a wide range of drivers for different hardware architectures, making it versatile for various platforms from embedded systems to large-scale servers.
